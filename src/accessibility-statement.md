This site is committed to ensuring that it's accessible to all, regardless of technology or ability.

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. This site strives to conform to WCAG 2.1 level AA.  

This site has been built using [W3C standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) for HTML and CSS. Any person using a past, present, or future browser that honors these standards should be capable of navigating this site. For example, you should be able to:

* Navigate using keyboard only.
* Zoom up to 400% without having to scroll horizontally to view any content.
* Navigate most of this site using speech recognition software.
* Navigate most of this site using a screen reader.
* Navigate all of this site if CSS fails to load.
* Navigate all of this site if JavaScript is disabled or fails to load.

In addition to being tested on modern browsers, this site has been checked for screen reader ease of use using VoiceOver with Safari in MacOS. It has also been audited using [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [Arc Toolkit](https://www.tpgi.com/arc-platform/arc-toolkit/) as well as checked manually.

## Known Issues
If you are Firefox user using a Zoom level above 100% and have the "Zoom text only" option enabled, the top-level navigation may be obscured by the "75 Total Adoptions" text. If this is the case, you can either reduce your zoom level until you can use the navigation, or scroll to the bottom of the page and use the navigation in the footer. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Issues with this site's accessibility can be submitted as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/superterrific/cats-in-residence/issues) or you can [contact us directly](/contact/). We take these issues very seriously and will try to address them as quickly as possible.
